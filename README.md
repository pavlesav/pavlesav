# 👋 Hi, I'm Pavle Savković

I’m a **Data Scientist / Applied ML Engineer** with an MSc in **Computational Social Systems (TU Graz)**.  
I build end-to-end pipelines that turn raw data into **models, evaluation, and clear insights**, especially in **NLP/Text Analytics** and **Computer Vision**.

⚽ Former professional football player, I like projects that are practical, performance-driven, and easy to demo.

## 🔎 What I’m focused on
- **NLP / Text Analytics:** topic modeling, embeddings, clustering, labeling & evaluation, linguistic style profiling  
- **Applied ML / Prototyping:** computer vision pipelines, tracking-by-detection, turning video into structured data  
- **Data Work:** Python + SQL, analysis, visualization, reproducible notebooks and workflows

---

## 🧰 Tech & Tools
**Languages:** Python, R, SQL, LaTeX  
**ML/NLP:** scikit-learn, PyTorch, spaCy, NLTK, BERTopic  
**Data:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
**Networks / Simulation:** NetworkX, Mesa  
**Workflow:** Git, Jupyter, Colab

## 🚀 Featured projects

### 1) 🏛️ Parliamentary NLP pipeline (MSc thesis)
**Repo:** https://github.com/pavlesav/master-thesis  
**Goal:** analyze large-scale parliamentary debates with context-aware topic modeling and linguistic style features.  
**Approach:** debate segmentation → embeddings → clustering/topic modeling → topic labeling → LIWC-22 style profiling → temporal analysis.  
**Status:** MSc thesis. **Manuscript in preparation** based on the same work.

**Quick start:** the repository README contains setup + how to reproduce the main results.

### 2) ⚽ Football computer vision (detection + tracking pipeline)
**Repo:** https://github.com/pavlesav/football-computer-vision  
**Goal:** turn match footage into structured data for downstream analytics and visual outputs.  
**Approach:** YOLO-based detection + tracking-by-detection pipeline (built on my own dataset).

---

### 3) 📊 Euro 2024 visualizations (Streamlit app)
**Repo:** https://github.com/pavlesav/Euro-2024-visualizations  
**Goal:** interactive match analytics and football graphics.  
**Approach:** data cleaning + feature building + plotting + app interface (Streamlit).  
Includes a deployed app link in the repo.
